I created this script to make fun of a colleague. When I call the official number of my company and enter the extension number, this script sees a certain part of the screen (the green handset) and starts a chain of actions, which in the end leads to the Internet being disconnected on the colleagueâ€™s computer.
P.S. My colleague laughed a lot =)
P.P.S The trick is taken from the movie "The Hummingbird Project"
